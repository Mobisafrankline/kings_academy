									<h3>Modern Computers</h3>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/modercomputer.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>At kings Academy we use the best computer for computer class.
										Modern computers have had a profound impact on our world and will continue 
										to shape the way we live, work, and communicate in the years to come.</p>
										<h2>The history of computers</h2>
										<p>The history of computers is a remarkable journey of human ingenuity and innovation spanning several centuries. 
											It all started with ancient tools like the abacus and mechanical calculators, gradually leading to the development 
											of electronic computers using vacuum tubes, transistors, and microprocessors. These milestones laid the groundwork for personal computers,
											 graphical user interfaces (GUI), and the internet, revolutionizing the way we interact with technology.

											The 20th century witnessed groundbreaking advancements in electronic computing.
											 The invention of vacuum tubes in the 1930s and 1940s enabled the creation of early electronic computers,
											  which played a crucial role in World War II and beyond. Transistors emerged in 1947, 
											  replacing vacuum tubes and revolutionizing computer design by offering enhanced speed, reliability, and miniaturization.
											
											The 1970s and 1980s brought about a computing revolution with the advent of personal computers like the Altair 8800, 
											Apple I and II, and Commodore PET, making computing accessible to individuals and small businesses. Additionally,
											 Xerox PARC's Alto computer introduced GUI and the mouse, significantly improving user-friendliness.
											
											In the 1990s, the Internet and the World Wide Web transformed global communication and information sharing,
											 connecting people worldwide. The 2000s and 2010s witnessed the rise of mobile computing, cloud computing, and big data technologies, 
											 further shaping modern technology.
											
											As we look ahead, artificial intelligence holds tremendous potential to revolutionize various industries and daily life,
											 while quantum computing promises unparalleled computational power. The history of computers stands as a testament to human creativity and persistence, 
											 driving us towards an exciting future of limitless possibilities.</p>
